    "Welcome to Dinosaurus Island! 65 million years ago, dinosaurs existed, and in this assignment they are back. You are in charge of a special task. Leading biology researchers are creating new breeds of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on earth, and your job is to give names to these dinosaurs. If a dinosaur does not like its name, it might go beserk, so choose wisely! \n",

Recall that your overall loop structure usually consists of a forward pass, a cost computation, a backward pass, and a parameter update. Before updating the parameters, you will perform gradient clipping when needed to make sure that your gradients are not \"exploding,\" meaning taking on overly large values. \n",

There are different ways to clip gradients; we will use a simple element-wise clipping procedure, in which every element of the gradient vector is clipped to lie between some range [-N, N]. More generally, you will provide a `maxValue` (say 10). In this example, if any component of the gradient vector is greater than 10, it would be set to 10; and if any component of the gradient vector is less than -10, it would be set to -10. If it is between -10 and 10, it is left alone. \n",

Your function takes in a maximum threshold and returns the clipped versions of your gradients.

You will represent $x^{\\langle t + 1 \\rangle }$ by creating a one-hot vector corresponding to the character you've chosen as your prediction.

    "You can see that your algorithm has started to generate plausible dinosaur names towards the end of the training. At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end you could see dinosaur names with cool endings. Feel free to run the algorithm even longer and play with hyperparameters to see if you can get even better results. Our implemetation generated some really cool names like `maconucon`, `marloralus` and `macingsersaurus`. Your model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in `saurus`, `don`, `aura`, `tor`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model generates some non-cool names, don't blame the model entirely--not all actual dinosaur names sound cool. (For example, `dromaeosauroides` is an actual dinosaur name and is in the training set.) But this model should give you a set of candidates from which you can pick the coolest! \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment had used a relatively small dataset, so that you could train an RNN quickly on a CPU. Training a model of the english language requires a much bigger dataset, and usually needs much more computation, and could run for many hours on GPUs. We ran our dinosaur name for quite some time, and so far our favoriate name is the great, undefeatable, and fierce: Mangosaurus!\n",

    "A similar (but more complicated) task is to generate Shakespeare poems. Instead of learning from a dataset of Dinosaur names you can use a collection of Shakespearian poems. Using LSTM cells, you can learn longer term dependencies that span many characters in the text--e.g., where a character appearing somewhere a sequence can influence what should be a different character much much later in ths sequence. These long term dependencies were less important with dinosaur names, since the names were quite short. \n",
